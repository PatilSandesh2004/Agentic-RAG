Agentic RAG System
Objective
Build an Agentic RAG System that uses AI agents to intelligently retrieve and
answer questions from documents.
Requirements
Your AI agent-powered system must:
1. Ingest data from the specified data sources
2. Store information in a vector database
3. Use agentic workflows to answer user queries
1. Agentic Workflow
• Demonstrate agentic behaviour in query processing
2. RAG Implementation
• Use any Vector Database
• Data Engineering is critical - show your thinking on data processing
3. LLM Integration
• Use any LLM of your choice
• Free APIs are acceptable (e.g., Google Gemini)
4. Data Source
System should support the following:
• Documents (PDF, DOCX, PPT)
• Excel
• Text File

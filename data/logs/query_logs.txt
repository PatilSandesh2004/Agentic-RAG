FINAL ANSWER:
Based on the given context, I can see that there are multiple documents with similar information. However, I can try to find the name mentioned in the document.

In Context 2, Context 3, and Context 4, I see that the name "Dell Technologies" is mentioned, but it's a company name, not a personal name.

In Context 5, I see a list of certifications and achievements, but I don't see any name mentioned in the document.

However, I do see a mention of "KLE Prerana PU College" and "Sri Krishnadevaraya Educational Society" which are institutions, but not a personal name.

Unfortunately, I don't see any personal name mentioned in the document.

So, my answer is: I don't know.
